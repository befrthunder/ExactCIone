Description: A package to construct the admissible exact intervals for the binomial proportion, 
             the poisson mean and the total number of subjects with a certain attribute 
             or the total number of the subjects for the hypergeometric distribution. 
             Both one-sided and two-sided intervals are of interest. This package can be 
             used to calculate the intervals constructed methods developed by Wang (2014) 
             and Wang (2015).
